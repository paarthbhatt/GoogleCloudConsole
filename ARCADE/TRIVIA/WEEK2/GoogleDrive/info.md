# Google Drive Tutorial

## Task 1. Upload and Store

You can store any file in Drive: pictures, drawings, videos, and more. After you store a file in Drive from one device, it is automatically available on all your other devices.

### Upload Files to Drive
To store files in Drive, use your web browser to upload them.

**Note:** If you’re using a supported browser, you can simply drag files directly from your computer to the Drive page on your browser.

1. In the left pane, click `New > File upload`.
2. Choose a file on your computer and click `Open`.
3. When you see `Upload complete` in the bottom right, your file has uploaded successfully and can be accessed in any browser or device that has Drive installed.

4. Click `New > Folder upload`.
5. Upload a few files and/or folders from your local computer to use later in this lab.
6. If you upload a file or folder with a name that matches the name of an existing file or folder, Drive gives you the option of Replacing the existing file or folder, or Keeping both files or folders.

7. Click `New > File upload`.
8. On your computer, choose the same file you previously uploaded and click `Open`.
9. Select `Replace existing file` and click `Upload`.

You may want to view or manage previous versions of the file or folder.

1. In Drive, right-click on the file you just uploaded and click `File information > Manage versions`.
2. You will see Version 1 of the file.

**Note:** To manage previous versions of a file, see Check or revert to earlier file versions.

To work on files from your desktop, see Store files on your desktop.

To upload files from your phone or tablet, see Upload files from your phone or tablet.

When you upload a file or folder, you see a message with "upload complete" and green checks next to the files listed, indicating the files have uploaded successfully.

**Upload complete message box**

You can use a browser or any device with Drive installed to access the uploaded files.

Click `Check my progress` to verify the objective.

## Task 2. Access Your Files

You can access files in Drive wherever you go — on your computer, phone, or tablet. When you update a file in Drive, Drive automatically syncs the changes. For example, if you update a file on your tablet, you can open the file on your laptop and see that update.

### Access Your Files Offline

**Note:** This lab does not support offline access, however, here are the steps you would use in your personal Google Account.

#### Set up offline access for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides

1. In Drive, click `Settings` settings icon > `Settings`.
2. In the offline section, check the `Sync Google files` box.

#### Set up offline access for PDFs, Microsoft® Office® files, and more on your desktop

1. To set up offline access for PDFs, Microsoft Office files, and other files: in Drive, click `Settings > Get Drive for Desktop`. The Google Drive page opens.
2. You can download the Drive for Desktop app from here. The Google Drive page also provides how to download this app for other platforms so you can use this app across your browser, mobile device, tablet, and computer.

## Task 3. View and Update

This section describes how to:
- Preview and download stored files on the web.
- Open your files.
- Update Drive files.
- Delete your files.
- Restore deleted files.

### Preview and Download Stored Files on the Web
Take a quick look at a Drive file. Right-click a file you uploaded and select `Open with > Preview`.

In the overlay, click the icons along the top and bottom to explore your options:
- Open your file with one of a list of suggested apps.
- Scroll down or up in your document files.
- Zoom in and out for zoom options of image files.
- Click the left arrow or right arrow to see the previous or next file in Drive.
- Open your file to edit it.

- Click `More actions` to share, move, rename a file, and more.

### Open Your Files
In Drive, double-click the file you want to open.

### Restore Drive Files
To restore an earlier version of a file that wasn't created in Docs, Sheets, or Slides see Restore deleted files.

### Delete Your Files
If you remove a file you own in Drive on any device, it's automatically removed from Drive on all of your devices and on the web.

**Note:** Removed files you own are moved to Trash in Drive and still count towards your total storage, until you permanently delete them on the web.

1. To remove a file from Drive, click to select a file and click the trash can icon in the top right.
2. To restore the file click `Trash` icon in the left pane to navigate to Trash.
3. Right-click to select one file or folder to restore and click `Restore`.
4. You can also select multiple files or folders to restore following the same process as step 3.

### Delete Files Permanently
1. Click `Trash` icon in the left pane to navigate to Trash.
2. To delete a file, right-click on the file and click `Delete forever`.
3. To delete all the files in Trash, click `Empty trash`. Then click `Delete forever`.

## Task 4. Organize and Search

Now that all your files are in Drive, here are some key ways to stay organized.

This section describes how to:
- Create folders.
- Move files to folders.
- Star important files and folders.
- Search and sort your files and folders.

### Create Folders
Any new folders you create in your computer’s Drive File Stream folders or in Drive on the web automatically appear on your devices so that you’re organized everywhere.

1. Click `My Drive` in the left pane.
2. Click `New > New Folder`.
3. Name the folder `Important Data` and click `CREATE`.
4. The folder you created is listed in `My Drive`.

Click `Check my progress` to verify the objective.

### Move Files to Folders
Move a file to a folder in My Drive:
- The easiest way to move a file into a folder is to drag and drop it into the folder.
- The other way is to right-click on a file > `Organize > Move` and then choose a folder.

### Star Important Files and Folders
Star important files or folders to find them quickly later.

1. Right-click a file or folder and select `Organize > Add to Starred`.
2. In the left pane, click `Starred` to see all your starred files and folders.

### Search and Sort Your Files and Folders
It's hard to browse through hundreds of files just to find the one you need. So, try searching Drive instead.

#### Search for Files or Folders in Drive
1. In the Drive search box at the top, enter a word or phrase.
2. To help you search faster, Drive suggests search terms as you enter text.
3. Click a suggestion to open it or click `Search` to see a list of results.

#### Use Advanced Search Options
1. On the right of the search box, click the `Search options` icon.
2. Choose any option or combination of options to filter your results further:
   - Type—Search by file type.
   - Owner—Search by file owner.
   - Location—Search by location (including items in the Trash or Starred). You can only search for folders that are in My Drive or Team Drives. To search a folder that is shared with you, you must first add the folder to My Drive.
   - Date modified—See items that were recently modified by anyone (not just you).
   - Item name—Search for a term in the file name.
   - Has the words—Search for files that contain certain words.
   - Shared to—Search for someone that has access to the file.
   - Follow up—Search for files you own with suggestions, or files with action items assigned to you.
3. Click `SEARCH`.

## Task 5. Share and Collaborate

After you share Drive files or folders, you can work on them with teammates or even people outside of your company.

This section describes how to:
- Share files and set access levels and visibility.
- View Drive activity and file details.
- Collaborate with Google Docs editors.

### Share Files and Set Access Levels and Visibility

2. Click `Share`. If you had successfully shared the file to a person in the previous step.
3. Click the access level (i.e., Editor, Viewer, Commenter) next to the person you want to stop sharing the file or folder with and click `Remove`.

### Collaborate with Google Docs Editors
In Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, and Google Sites, individuals can work together in the same document in real time. Commenting on any file brings a conversation into context so you avoid the back-and-forth of email and the resulting lost time.

   - Google Docs
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Slides
   - Google Forms
   - Google Drawings
